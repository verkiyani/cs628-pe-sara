Input

The program takes a list of movies as input, where each movie is represented . The movie data is stored in an array within the MovieList component. Additionally, user input is accepted through a dropdown menu that allows the selection of movie genres to filter the displayed list.

Process

When the user selects a genre from the dropdown menu, the program filters the list to show only the movies that match the selected genre. Furthermore, an event handler is implemented to detect when a movie is clicked, displaying an alert with the movie title. The program utilizes JSX to dynamically render the filtered list of movies based on the user's selection.

Output

The output consists of a visually structured list of movies. Each movie is shown as a separate card, containing the title, genre, and release year. When a specific genre is selected, only relevant movies are displayed.
