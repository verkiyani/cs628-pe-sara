# Cities Application

## Input
The Cities Application is about Cities list. The input fields are:  
- City Name 
- Country 
- Population


## Process
1. Frontend (React + React Router + Bootstrap)
   - The application has three main pages: Cities List, Add City, and City Details.
   - The application also uses "React Router" to navigate between pages.

2. Backend (Node.js + Express)
   - The backend handles HTTP requests using Express.js.
   - When a city is added, it is saved in a **MongoDB database** using **Mongoose**.

3. Database (MongoDB)
   - MongoDB stores the city details in a NoSQL collection.

## Output
- The "Cities List" page displays all stored cities.
- Clicking on a city navigates to the "City Details".
